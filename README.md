Wizzard Engine

The Wizzard Engine is intended to be a game engine and editor for simple, 2D side-scrolling games.

The primary focus is on creating a blind accessible user interface with additional features like screen reader compatibility, so blind and partially sighted developers can still use the tool to make levels.

This application is part of my 4th year undergraduate honours project.
